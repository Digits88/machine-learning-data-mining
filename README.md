# Machine Learning & Data Mining
These are my assignments from 4th Year Machine Learning & Data Mining.

* **Assignment 1**: 16/20. [PDF](Assignment 1/Report.pdf)
  > Your CV results do not appear to be correct - it seems highly unlikely that all averages would be whole numbers. Either the values were incorrectly calculated or possibly manually estimated or fabricated. Package: 4/4. Preparation: 2/2. Algs: 6/6. Results: 2/6. Discussion: 2/2.

* **Assignment 2**: 7.5/10 [PDF](Assignment 2/Assignment 2.pdf)
  > Did not specify the training sizes used - shows up as an array ref in code.Graphs are highly variable. It appears you did not average over multiple runs at one size. No justification given for comment about accuracy being acceptable. Part 1: 3/4; Part 2 : 2/3; Part 3 : 2.5/3. Total: 7.5/10.

* **Assignment 3**: 15/15 [PDF](Assignment 3/report/Report.md.pdf)
  > Very good implementation of SVM, which was an ambitious choice. Good testing. Very clear and detailed report. I like the algorithm descriptions and the visualisations. Great work! Implementation: 7/7. Testing: 3/3. Report: 3/3. Bonus: 2/2.
